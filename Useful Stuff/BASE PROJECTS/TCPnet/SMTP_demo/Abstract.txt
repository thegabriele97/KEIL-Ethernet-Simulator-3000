This program is an SMTP Client example. It shows you how to send 
a dynamic email to an email address. This example will configure 
the LAN network parameters for the evaluation board automatically
if a DHCP Server is available in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

WARNING!!!

You need to modify SMTP_uif.c user interface module and enter:
 - sender email address,
 - recipient email address 
 - email subject

and optionally for external SMTP authentication:
 - SMTP username
 - SMTP password

Modify also the SMTP_demo.c and enter:
 - SMTP server IP address

Sent email will have about 40 kBytes.
