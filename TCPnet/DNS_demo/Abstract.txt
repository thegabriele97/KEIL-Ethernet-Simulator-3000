This program shows you how to resolve an IP address of a Host
from the Host name. It sends a DNS request to a remote DNS server. 

This example will configure the LAN network parameters for 
the evaluation board automatically if a DHCP Server is available
in your LAN.

If you do not have a DHCP server, you need to configure
the IP address, net mask and default gateway and Primary DNS
and Secondary DNS Server manually in the Net_Config.c configuration
file. You have to disable also 'Dynamic Host Configuration' under 
the 'Ethernet Network Interface' section.

The DNS_demo example is available for several targets:

MCB1700:       Standalone application for Keil MCB1700 Board.
               Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

MCB1700 Debug: Standalone Debug application. Debug level configured
               in Net_Debug.c debug configuration file.
               System messages printed to COM1 serial port.

               Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM1 port to view
               output messages using HyperTerminal at 115200 baud,
               8-bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.
