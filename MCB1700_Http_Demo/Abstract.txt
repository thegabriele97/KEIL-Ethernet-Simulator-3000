This is a HTTP Server example prebuild for the Keil MCB1700 
Evaluation Board. It also shows how to use the Web Server CGI 
interface. 

Use this example to connect MCB1700 Board to a LAN with DHCP
server (most LANs have this). This example will configure the 
LAN network parameters automatically using a DHCP protocol.

You may connect MCB1700 Board to PC directly over a crosslink
network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a static 
IP address 192.168.0.1

If after a timeout of 5 seconds DHCP did not obtain an IP address,
this example will use a static IP address 192.168.0.100

The WEB pages are included into the project under HTTP Files 
group. You can simply add or remove a page or image. Web files
which are compiled into the project are added to the 'Web.inp'
Web Converter input file.

To use this example:

  - Connect ULINK to the MCB1700 Evaluation Board and power the board up. 
  - In uVision - load the project file and execute Flash - Download.
  - Connect the MCB1700 Board to a LAN with DHCP server (most LANs have this)
  - Connect your computer to the same LAN and open your web browser and 
    enter the address http://mcb1700/ or http://<boards IP address>/
    
This opens the demo page running on the MCB2300 Board. Enter:

User name: admin 
Password: <none> 

You can change the password at runtime on page 'system'

The HTTP_demo example is available for several targets:

MCB1700:       Standalone (no RTX Kernel) application.
               Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.

MCB1700 Debug: Standalone (no RTX Kernel) with debug output.
               Debug level configured in Net_Debug.c configuration file.
               Connect a serial cable to RS232 COM1 port using
               HyperTerminal at 115200 baud, 8-bits, no parity,
               1 stop bit, XON/XOFF.

MCB1700 RTX:   The same example configured for RTX Kernel.

This pre-compiled version is for target "MCB1700" and may be 
downloaded using a evalution version of the RealView MDK-ARM package 
(available at www.keil.com/demo).
